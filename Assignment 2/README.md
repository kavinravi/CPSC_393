Known issues: Struggled with how to do the train/test split since I didn't know if doing a classical train/test split would work as it did for normal ML models. Turns out there was a way to use classic TTS. Also struggled with how to even use UMAP as well as miscellaneous issues solved on either StackOverflow, TensorFlow documentation, or UMAP documentation.
